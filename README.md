Update: The website is no longer deployed.

The goal of this project was to keep and track in catagorised form, of the pdf's and diffrent study materials provided by our collage,
during the covid time when classes where being conducted online.

The study materials were sent in Whatsapp group's, and finding a specific one was an headache, especially when you don't remember it's name.
Moreover the documents sent in whatsapp could only be downloaded for the next 60 days from the day of sending.

Hence this website, which kep't a track of downloadable links of the same study material stored and shared through google drive.
